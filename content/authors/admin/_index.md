I am a Ph.D. student in the [Software Engineering Laboratory](https://naist-se.github.io/) at Nara Institute of Science and Technology. My research interest consists of studies on text classification, such as self-admitted technical debt and sentiment classification. My other side project is a study on Blockchain. My research collaborates with Prof. Christoph Treude, Prof. Michele Lanza, Prof. Gabriele Bavota, and Prof. Hideaki Hata.
