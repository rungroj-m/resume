title: "Wait For It: Identifying “On-Hold”Self-Admitted Technical Debt"
abstract: "This paper reports on the results of a qualitative study on the
  removal of self-admitted technical debt (SATD), and reveals a particular class
  of self-admitted technical debt which is amenable to automated management:
  ``on-hold SATD''. We define on-hold SATD as self-admitted technical debt which
  contains a condition to indicate that a developer is waiting for a certain
  event or an updated functionality having been implemented elsewhere. We then
  design and evaluate an automated classifier which can identify these on-hold
  instances with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
  of 0.98 as well as detect the specific conditions that developers are waiting
  for."
