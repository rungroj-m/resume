abstract: "Self-admitted technical debt refers to situations where a software
  developer knows that their current implementation is not optimal and indicates
  this using a source code comment. In this work, we hypothesize that it is
  possible to develop automated techniques to understand a subset of these
  comments in more detail, and to propose tool support that can help developers
  manage self-admitted technical debt more effectively. Based on a qualitative
  study of 333 comments indicating self-admitted technical debt, we first
  identify one particular class of debt amenable to automated management:
  on-hold self-admitted technical debt (on-hold SATD), i.e., debt which contains
  a condition to indicate that a developer is waiting for a certain event or an
  updated functionality having been implemented elsewhere. We then design and
  evaluate an automated classifier which can identify these on-hold instances
  with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.98
  as well as detect the specific conditions that developers are waiting for. Our
  work presents a first step towards automated tool support that is able to
  indicate when certain instances of self-admitted technical debt are ready to
  be addressed."
