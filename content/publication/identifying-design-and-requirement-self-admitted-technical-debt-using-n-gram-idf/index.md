abstract: >
  In software projects, technical debt takes place when a developer adopting a
  trivial solution containing quick and easy shortcuts to implement over a
  suitable solution that can take a longer time to solve a problem. This can
  cause major additional costs leading to negative impacts for software
  maintenance since those shortcuts might need to be reworked in the future.
  Detecting technical debt early can help a team cope with those risks. In this
  paper, we focus on Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) that is a debt
  intentionally produced by developers. We propose an automated model to
  identify two most common types of self-admitted technical debt, requirement
  and design debt, from source code comments. We combine N-gram IDF and
  auto-sklearn machine learning to build the model. With the empirical
  evaluation on ten projects, our approach outperform the baseline method by
  improving the performance over 20% when identifying requirement self-admitted
  technical debt and achieving an average F1-score of 64% when identifying
  design self-admitted technical debt.
