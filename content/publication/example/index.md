abstract: Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) is a special form of technical
  debt in which developers intentionally record their hacks in the code by
  adding comments for attention. Here, we focus on issue-related "On-hold SATD",
  where developers suspend proper implementation due to issues reported inside
  or outside the project. When the referenced issues are resolved, the On-hold
  SATD also need to be addressed, but since monitoring these issue reports takes
  a lot of time and effort, developers may not be aware of the resolved issues
  and leave the On-hold SATD in the code. In this paper, we propose FixMe, a
  GitHub bot that helps developers detecting and monitoring On-hold SATD in
  their repositories and notify them whenever the On-hold SATDs are ready to be
  fixed (i.e. the referenced issues are resolved). The bot can automatically
  detect On-hold SATD comments from source code using machine learning
  techniques and discover referenced issues. When the referenced issues are
  resolved, developers will be notified by FixMe bot. The evaluation conducted
  with 11 participants shows that our FixMe bot can support them in dealing with
  On-hold SATD. FixMe is available at https://www.fixmebot.app/ and FixMe's VDO
  is at https://youtu.be/YSz9kFxN_YQ.
